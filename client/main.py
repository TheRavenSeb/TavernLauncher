"""
Client launcher entry point. Loads whichever addons the user has
actually enabled (see the in-app Addons window / client/core/
addon_loader.py) BEFORE building the main window, so every enabled
addon has already registered its tabs/hooks by the time
ClientLauncher._build_main_ui() runs.

Addons are no longer baked in at build time -- this .exe is always
"core only"; addons/ is a plain folder of .py files expected to sit
right next to it, loaded dynamically at startup based on what's saved
in client_enabled_addons.json.
