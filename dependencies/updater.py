"""
Shared self-update logic for both TavernLauncher exes.

Checks GitHub Releases (ModdingTavern/TavernLauncher) for a newer version
and, if the user agrees, downloads the new build and installs it.

Release process this expects
-----------------------------
One zip per *app* per release (not one combined zip for both) — this
changed after the combined zip turned out to be ~84MB, meaning every
single-app update was downloading and extracting roughly double what it
actually needed, and a "stuck" report turned out to at least partly be a
plain size problem (see the notes further down). Attach two separate
assets to the release, named:
    TavernLauncher-Client-vX.Y.Z.zip
    TavernLauncher-Server-vX.Y.Z.zip
(matching the release's own tag, vX.Y.Z — bump APP_VERSION in the source
to match before building). Each zip contains just that app's own files,
flat at the top level, no wrapping subfolder needed anymore since the zip
itself is already app-specific:

    TavernLauncher - Client.exe
    Patch/
        <DLL files>
    addons/
        <addon folders>

addons/ is the SAME folder contents in both zips (an addon can matter to
either side, or both) -- whichever one a given install actually has gets
synced, file-by-file, on every update; see _sync_folder below. Nothing
here deletes a file it doesn't recognize, so a third-party addon someone
dropped in themselves (never part of any release) is never touched.

Because the asset filename embeds both the app name and the version, this
can't use the same "latest/download/<fixed-name>" trick end to end — the
filename literally changes every release. Instead:
  1. Resolve the *tag* from the plain "/releases/latest" alias (this one's
     always the same URL — no filename involved, so nothing to look up
     first).
  2. Compute the expected zip filename from that tag and the app folder.
  3. Use the filename-specific "latest/download/<name>" alias to get the
     actual asset URL, and verify it's real (see _asset_exists — GitHub's
     alias redirects blindly even for a name that doesn't exist, so the
     redirect landing somewhere isn't proof by itself).

This only ever does anything when frozen (a real built .exe) — running as
a plain .py script during development is always a no-op, since
sys.executable would just be the Python interpreter, not anything
meaningful to replace.

Self-update strategy (and why it changed)
-------------------------------------------
An earlier version of this had the currently-running process download the
update, then rename its own .old-suffixed self aside and rename a staged
copy into place — the standard "you can rename a running exe on Windows
even though you can't overwrite it" trick. Real-world reports of it
hanging at the file-replace step, even after retry-protecting every
individual file operation against transient locks, suggested something
retries alone couldn't fix: a process that downloads something and then
modifies its own executable is behaviorally indistinguishable from how a
lot of self-updating malware operates, which is exactly the pattern
antivirus/EDR *behavioral* heuristics are built to watch for.

That's still probably worth avoiding, so this keeps the "launch a staged
exe with a flag, let a fresh process do the actual install" approach:
  1. The currently-running app downloads its own release zip straight to
     a temp file on disk and extracts it to a staging directory.
  2. It launches the *staged* exe with a --finish-update flag, and exits.
  3. That fresh process — which made no network requests itself — waits
     briefly for the old process to release its own exe, renames the old
     one aside, renames itself into the final location, copies over
     Patch/, relaunches from the correct path, and exits.

But investigating a further "still stuck" report surfaced a second,
independent, much more mundane problem: the combined zip was ~84MB, and
this module's own download progress callback fired once per 64KB chunk —
over 1,300 separate callback invocations for that one file, each
scheduling a GUI update on the main thread from a background thread. And
extraction showed one single static "Extracting..." message for the
entire duration, with no visible movement until it was completely done.
Tens of megabytes of decompression taking 10-30+ seconds while showing
zero incremental feedback is indistinguishable from "hung" even when
working *perfectly*. Splitting into per-app zips halves the affected
size; throttling download progress and reporting extraction per-file (see
_download_to_file and _do_extract below) means there's now visible,
continuous movement throughout instead of one frozen-looking message.

Both apps call finish_update_if_requested() at the very top of their
entry point, before any GUI initialization — it's a no-op unless this
process was actually launched to finish an update.
